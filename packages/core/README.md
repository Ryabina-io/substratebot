# Substrate Telegram Bot

Core Lib for Substrate Telegram Bot.

## Install

```
npm i @ryabina-io/substratebot
```

## Use

```js
const substrateBot = new SubstrateBot({
  settings,
  api,
  modules,
  modes,
  getNetworkStatsMessage
})
substrateBot.run()
```

### `config.settings`

main bot settings, should contain substrate network params (name, prefix, decimals, token), telegram bot token, start & validators messages, links (governance, common), list of group alerts.

#### sample:

```js
const settings = {
  network: {
    name: "Kusama",
    prefix: "2",
    decimals: "12",
    token: "KSM",
  },
  startMsg: "Hello. This is Substrate BOT!",
  validatorsMessage: "This message shows up when /validators call",
  governanceLinks: ["commonwealth", "polkassembly", "subscan", "polkascan"],
  commonLinks: ["subscan", "polkascan"],
  groupAlerts: {
    events: [
      ["democracy", "Proposed"],
      ["democracy", "Started"],
      ["treasury", "Proposed"],
    ],
    calls: [
      ["treasury", "tipNew"],
      ["treasury", "reportAwesome"],
    ],
  },
  botToken: process.env.BOT_TOKEN,
  dbFilePath: process.env.DB_FILE_PATH,
}
```

`network` - basic network parameters. Most often, the bot will take these parameters from the api, but if they are undefined, it will use settings.

`startMsg` - this message is sent to the user after calling the /start command.

`validatorsMessage` - this message is sent to the user after calling the /validators command.

The information in alerts is often not complete, so it is very useful to add links to network explorers.

`governanceLinks` - links under governance messages (e.g. democracy.proposed)

`commonLinks` - links under regular messages

`groupAlerts` - bot also works in group chats, but its functionality is limited and can notify about events described in this parameter. It's written in that style:

```js
groupAlerts: {
    events:[
        ["moduleName","eventName"]
    ],
    calls:[
        ["moduleName","callName"]
    ]
}
```

`botToken` - telegram bot token. Information about how to authorize your own bot, you can find [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#authorizing-your-bot).

`dbFilePath` - path to db.json file

```json
{
  "notifications": [],
  "users": []
}
```

### `config.api`

[polkadot-api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) instance for connect to node.
API functions that uses by bot:

- api.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHeads
- api.rpc.chain.getHeader
- api.rpc.chain.getBlockHash
- api.rpc.chain.getBlock
- api.query.system.events
- api.query.balances.locks
- api.query.staking.ledger
- api.derive.accounts.info
- api.query.staking.nominators (not required)

If API instance do not support any function from this list, the bot is not compatible with your Substrate version of the network.

### `config.modules`

this parameter describes the structure of events in the node. A Substrate node consists of modules that consist of constants, storages data, events and extrinsincs. Two components of the module are important to the bot: events and extrinsincs.

To describe the modules it is necessary to maintain this style:

```js
const modules = {
  ModuleName: {
    short: "ShrtMdlNm",
    events: {
      EventName: {
        short: "ShrtEvntNm",
        documentation: "This is full doccumentation that describe this event",
        args: [
          {
            name: "argName",
            type: "argType",
            baseType: "baseType",
            visible: "hide",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    calls: {
      ExtrinsicName: {
        short: "ShrtExtrnscNm",
        documentation:
          "This is full doccumentation that describe this extrinsic",
        args: [
          {
            name: "argName",
            type: "argType",
            baseType: "baseType",
            visible: "hide",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`substratebot/tools/utils` have a useful feature - `metaConvertToConfig(api, ingoreList)`. It will allow you to automatically load metadata from the node in the format required for the bot. `ignoreList` is a list of ignored events and calls, as well as instructions for displaying the visible flag. sample:

```js
const ingoreList = {
  events: [
    "ExtrinsicSuccess",
    "ExtrinsicFailed",
    "BatchInterrupted",
    "BatchCompleted",
  ],
  calls: ["batch"],
  /// All types in this list will be shown in the FILTER menu
  hide: [
    "GenericAccountId",
    "GenericAddress",
    "u8",
    "u16",
    "u32",
    "u64",
    "u128",
    "u256",
    "i8",
    "i16",
    "i32",
    "i64",
    "i128",
    "i256",
    "bool",
  ],
}
```

**NOTE!** In the Substrate SDK the events do not have names for their arguments, only the data types. Therefore, `metaConvertToConfig` method works according to the following algorithm:

1. if the event description corresponds to this [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/6684),
   then the names of the arguments correspond to those described in square brackets.
2. if not, we convert the type name in the camel-case and in case of repeated types we add a serial number to the event. (In this case, you'll most likely need a manual correction)

### `config.modes`

By default, the bot has only one event and call mode - `Advanced`. It contains everything you have described in the modules. But it is very difficult to navigate through all the event/calls lists of all the modules. For simplicity, we have added the option to group events into additional modes. Sample:

```js
  const modes = [
    {
      /// Modes name. Shows in the name of the mode button
      name: "Address alerts",
      // Unique index, must contain signle letter, no repeats are allowed.
      index: "u",
      // Modes description.
      description:
        "Here are most useful events for your account.\n\nYou can selectüü¢/ unselect‚ö™Ô∏è by clicking on them.",
      // If events/calls in the mode need filtering by address, the flag is true.
      isAddressFiltering: true,
      // List of events/calls
      alerts: [
        {
          // Name that shows in alerts menu
          name: "Transfer",
          // Which module contain this event/call
          contract: "balances",
          // Event name, if this is not event then write
          // call: "Transfer"
          event: "Transfer",
          // list of arguments which should filter by input address
          filters: ["from", "to"],
          // short name of event/call
          short: "Trnsfr",
          // default value of select
          selected: true,
        }
      ]
    }
```

### `config.getNetworkStatsMessage`

This is the function that the bot calls when it needs to respond to the query "show current network statistics".
